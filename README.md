# College Warden

[CollegeWarden](https://college.hpfm.dev) is a dead simple web app that allows you to keep track of your college applications.

# Why

I made this app to track my college apps in 2020. 
Once you've applied to your choice of colleges you would want to track your portal URLs, passwords, your essays, deadlines and everything else.
CollegeWarden has got you covered. In addition, you can also store your documents securely in the files tab.

All information is encrypted locally using your password and then uploaded on the server. 

The [backend](https://github.com/Hydrophobefireman/collegewarden-backend) does not even know which colleges you applied to.
